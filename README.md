# Scrape Analytics

# Overview

I had a linux machine setup in my house to automatically webscrape data I needed for various projects. 
This project includes a websocket client and server that would allow real-time streaming data about the servers'
CPU, and Memory usage. It also could track battery level from the Battery Backup (UPS) it was hooked up to in 
case of a power outage.
